# PowerBI-project

**Final Project: Power BI & Power Pivot/Query View**

**Project Objective**

The objective of this practical project is to apply the methodologies and aspects learned in the course, including:
- Architecture planning
- Development and analysis using various tools, languages, and platforms:

  - Power BI
  - Power Pivot/Query View
  - DAX

During the project, you will need to address various challenges such as data population, infrastructure development, data processing and analysis, understanding the business environment, handling error messages, design mistakes, etc. The project will help you understand the complexities of the analysis world while finding high-quality solutions to different problems.

**Planning Stages**

The planning stages include, among others, the following steps:
1. Understanding requirements
2. Analyzing data sources, origins, and destinations
3. Developing the project using Microsoft tools
4. Establishing a star schema topology infrastructure
5. Creating a business layer (Semantic Layer)
6. Analyzing and drawing conclusions

**Project Presentation**

Attached to the project are two databases: an SQL Server database and a CSV file. The databases belong to an operational system called "Happy_Insurance" of the "Happy_Insurance" company. Together, they form the database of the "Happy Insurance" company and represent three years of business activity.

**Goals:**

- Present insights into the company's performance.
- The best way to achieve this is by identifying significant trends and changes in various metrics.

**Development Stages**

Attached to this project:

- An SQL file for creating the DB, tables, and objects as a data source. 
  - This file should be run under an SQL Server instance. Upon completion, a new DB named "Happy_Insurance" will be created.
  - A CSV file as an additional data source, detailing countries and regions.

**Main Stages/Requirements**

- Develop an ETL process to transfer data from the databases to a star schema using Power Query and M Language.
- Develop a Tabular model using Power Pivot to provide quick and high-quality answers to the organization's business questions with minimal effort by end users.
- Create reports and data visualizations using Power BI.
